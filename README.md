# Simple vector Database Tutorial - Chat with your custom data
We will be using a publicly available story ([a txt file](https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/plain-text/stud.txt)) in this example. We will split the story, create chunks and embeddings.
We will use [SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/cloud-trial/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pavan&utm_term=yt&utm_content=vectrdb) as our vector database to store our embeddings. Then, we will try to chat with our story asking numerous questions/queries related to the story.
